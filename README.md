# colegarvey.github.io
A personal website that I developed to give an overview of some of the things that I have done.  

Created with HTML/CSS mixed with a bit of Bootstrap components to create a very simple and somewhat barebones but clear and professional looking design and feel to the current state of the website.

There is much more to be done in the future.  You can currently find a general description about myself involving where I stand academically and a bit about my interests outside of academics.  You can view some of the personal projects I have done (when they get added) and the most recent version of my resume.
