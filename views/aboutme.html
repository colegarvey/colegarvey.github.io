<!-- Description -->

    <p>
      I am currently attending the University of Colorado - Boulder as an undergraduate student.  Pursuing a bachelors degree in Computer Science within CU's College of 
      Engineering and Applied Science, the top-ranked engineering school in Colorado, as well as a minor in Data Science within CU's College of Media, Communication and Information!
      <br><br>
      I love to be active and live an active lifestyle.  I love going to the gym, it has to be one of my favorite activities/hobby that I do daily.  I love being outside when the weather 
      is warm and engage in all sorts of activities like hiking, running, swimming, and yard games.  When the weather gets cold I like to stay inside a little more, aside from taking 
      trips into the mountains to go snowboarding on the weekends!
      <br><br>
      <!-- Since I was a kid, I have always had the desire to build something.  I fell in love with the feeling you get when you fix something, when you put all the pieces together and 
      build something that looks nothing like what you started with.  I still have that want, that passion to create something that not only I could use.  But for others to use, now and 
      in the future.   -->
